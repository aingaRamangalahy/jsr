# JSResources (JSR)

JSResources (JSR) is a community-driven platform designed to help JavaScript developers discover, share, and curate valuable learning materials, tools, and libraries. Our goal is to create a central hub where developers of all levels can find high-quality resources to enhance their skills and stay up-to-date with the ever-evolving JavaScript ecosystem.

Whether you're looking for tutorials on a new framework, a handy utility library, or insightful articles on best practices, JSR aims to provide a well-organized and easily searchable collection. Users can contribute by submitting new resources, voting on existing ones, and participating in discussions.

## Key Features (Planned/In Development)

*   **Resource Curation:** Submit, categorize, and tag JavaScript resources.
*   **Voting & Ranking:** Upvote your favorite resources to help others find the best content.
*   **Search & Filtering:** Easily find resources based on keywords, categories, tags, and popularity.
*   **User Accounts:** Create a profile, track your contributions, and save your favorite resources.
*   **Community Driven:** Open for contributions and discussions.

## Running Locally with Docker

To get a local instance of JSR running for development or testing, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jsr.git
    cd jsr
    ```
    *(Replace `yourusername` with the actual GitHub username or organization if different)*

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example environment file and customize it as needed:
    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```
    Ensure you have a `MONGODB_URI` configured in your `.env` file. For local development, this can point to a local MongoDB instance or a free tier MongoDB Atlas database. The `env.example` file provides a template for a local Docker-based MongoDB.

3.  **Start the Application:**
    Use Docker Compose to build and run the application services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    Once the containers are up and running, you can access the different parts of the application:
    *   **Frontend:** [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)
    *   **Admin Dashboard:** [http://localhost:80/admin](http://localhost:80/admin)
    *   **API:** [http://localhost:80/api](http://localhost:80/api)
    *   **API Documentation:** [http://localhost:80/api-docs](http://localhost:80/api-docs)

## Deployment

To deploy JSResources to a production environment, you will generally need to:

1.  **Prepare a Server:**
    Set up a server (e.g., a VPS) with Docker and Docker Compose installed.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file on your server with your production settings. This will include:
    *   `MONGODB_ATLAS_URI`: Your production MongoDB connection string (MongoDB Atlas is recommended for production).
    *   `NODE_ENV=production`
    *   Any other necessary API keys or secrets.

3.  **Obtain the Code:**
    Clone the repository onto your server:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jsr.git
    cd jsr
    ```

4.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    Use the production Docker Compose file to build and start the services:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
    ```

5.  **Set Up a Reverse Proxy & SSL:**
    It is highly recommended to set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx) in front of the application. This will allow you to:
    *   Handle SSL/TLS termination (HTTPS).
    *   Serve multiple applications on the same server if needed.
    *   Improve security and performance.
    The `nginx-host-config.conf` file in the repository provides an example Nginx configuration. You will need to adapt it to your domain and SSL certificate setup (e.g., using Let's Encrypt).

6.  **Configure DNS:**
    Point your domain name's DNS records to your server's IP address.

This provides a general outline. Specific steps may vary based on your hosting provider and exact server configuration.
